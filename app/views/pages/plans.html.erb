<h1>About Allan and his plans</h1>
<p>Hi! my name is Allan and I just graduated from CSUS with a BS in Accouting. This is one of the first applications I have built, and I'm learning Ruby on Rails because...well honestly...just to do it! I'm currently not sure what I will do with this project once I'm all done with the one month rails course, so my current plan is just to know more about ruby on rails today then I did yesterday!</p>
