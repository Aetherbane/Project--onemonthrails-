<h1>About Allan and his plans</h1>
<p>Hi! my name is Allan and I just graduated from CSUS with a BS in Accouting. This is one of the first applications I have built, and I'm learning Ruby on Rails just to do it! I'm currently not sure what I will do with this project once I'm all done with the one month rails course. For now, I will just make it my goal to know more today then I did yesterday!</p>
